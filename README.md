# Nitro Generator by StodiusDev
This is a nitro generator that will open up soon. This was made with Python. Please do not change anything in the main script unless you have knowledge of python. Have questions or concerns? DM me on Discord: StodiusDev#0001

# Set Up
You need to download python - here's how you can check if you have it installed already.
    1. Open the Command Prompt by searching for "command prompt" in the windows search bar.
    2. Type "pip" and enter, if there's an error, you don't have it.
    3. If you do have it, it will show you a bunch of commands.
Don't have it installed? Go to - https://www.python.org/downloads/ - and download the latest version.

After that, you need to go to "install" and it will install everything you need for the nitro gen.
Now all you have to do is open up the main.exe file and you can generate codes.

*Note: It is not my fault if you lose your account or if you get banned by using this. I would use an alt account for these type of things.
